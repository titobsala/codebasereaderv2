# codebasereaderv2
Update on the codebase reader I had, but using Charm with more capabilities:

CodebaseReader v2, multi-language codebase analysis and summarization tool with a beautiful Terminal User Interface (TUI), built with Go and the Charm Bracelet libraries.(A placeholder for a future screenshot of your awesome TUI!)About The ProjectCodebaseReader is a powerful tool for developers, team leads, and security auditors to quickly understand and gain insights into unfamiliar codebases. It scans a project directory, performs a static analysis of the source code, and presents the findings in a clean, interactive TUI.Unlike its predecessor, this version is built in Go and features a pluggable, multi-language architecture. This means it's no longer limited to just Pythonâ€”it's designed from the ground up to be easily extendable to support any programming language.Key Features:Interactive TUI: Navigate your codebase and view analysis results directly in your terminal.Blazing Fast: Leverages Go's concurrency to analyze files in parallel.Multi-Language Support: A pluggable parser system makes adding new languages straightforward. (Currently supports: Go, Python)Code Metrics: Get a quick overview of lines of code, function/class counts, and complexity.AI-Powered Summaries: Integrate with AI providers (like Anthropic or OpenAI) to generate technical summaries of your project.Single Binary: Distribute and run the tool as a single executable with no dependencies.Built WithThis project is made possible by the incredible open-source work of the Go community.GoCharm Bracelet:Bubble Tea (TUI Framework)Lipgloss (Styling)Bubbles (TUI Components)Getting StartedTo get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.
Build the application:The go build command will compile the project into a single executable binary in the current directory.go build -o codebasereader .
UsageSimply run the compiled binary. By default, it will scan the current directory../codebasereader
You can also specify a target directory to analyze:./codebasereader /path/to/your/project
Once running, use the arrow keys to navigate the TUI.RoadmapThis project is actively under development.
