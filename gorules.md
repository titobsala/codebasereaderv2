## 1. Core Philosophy: The "Go Way" üéØ
Go's design choices often prioritize clarity over cleverness. If you remember one thing, it's this: clear is better than clever.

Simplicity Over Features: Go intentionally leaves out features common in other languages (like classes, inheritance, generics until recently, exceptions). This isn't a weakness; it's a feature designed to keep codebases simple and uniform, making it easy for any Go developer to jump into a new project.

Composition Over Inheritance: This is a fundamental principle. Instead of creating complex class hierarchies (e.g., Dog is an Animal), you build types by combining smaller, independent pieces. In Go, a Dog has a Mover component and has a Speaker component. This is often done using struct embedding.

"A little copying is better than a little dependency": This is Go's answer to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. While Go developers avoid large-scale duplication, they are not afraid to repeat a few lines of code if it makes the function more self-contained and avoids creating a confusing abstraction or an unnecessary dependency. Pulling three lines into a new helper function might not always be cleaner.

## 2. Code Organization & Structure üì¶
This addresses your "600+ line file" and "modular components" points.

Packages are the Core: The primary unit of organization in Go is the package. A package is simply all the .go files in a single directory. A good package has a clear and singular purpose (e.g., the standard library's net/http package handles HTTP, encoding/json handles JSON). This is how you achieve modularity.

Keep Packages Focused: If a package starts doing too many things, it should be split. The name of the package should make its purpose obvious.

File Size is a "Smell," Not a Rule: There's no hard rule like "files must be under 600 lines." However, a very large file is a strong indicator (a "code smell") that a struct or a set of functions is doing too much work. It's a signal that you should step back and see if you can break the logic into smaller, more focused files or even new packages.

Exporting (Public vs. Private): Go's visibility rule is simple and powerful. If a function, type, or variable starts with a capital letter (e.g., MyFunction), it is exported (public) and can be used by other packages. If it starts with a lowercase letter (e.g., myFunction), it is unexported (private) and only visible within its own package.

## 3. Design Patterns in Go üé®
Many classic "Gang of Four" design patterns are either unnecessary or implemented much more simply in Go.

Interfaces are Implicit: A type satisfies an interface automatically if it has all the required methods. You don't need an implements keyword. This encourages small, focused interfaces and makes decoupling components very easy.

Factory Pattern: This is often just a simple function. Instead of a UserFactory class, you'll have a NewUser(name string) (*User, error) function. It's clean, simple, and idiomatic.

No "STUPID" vs. "SOLID": Go's design naturally pushes you away from the things STUPID warns against (like Singletons and tight coupling). Its emphasis on small interfaces and focused packages naturally aligns with SOLID principles, especially the Single Responsibility and Interface Segregation principles.

## 4. Tooling and Best Practices üõ†Ô∏è
Go comes with powerful, non-negotiable tools that enforce a standard way of working.

gofmt (or goimports): This is the most important tool. It automatically formats your code according to the community standard. There are no arguments about style (tabs vs. spaces, brace placement). Everyone's code looks the same. You should configure your editor to run this on save.

golangci-lint: This is the de-facto standard linter for Go projects. It's an aggregator that runs dozens of different checks for everything from code complexity and unused variables to common performance pitfalls. You can configure it with a .golangci.yml file to enforce specific rules for your team.

Explicit Error Handling: Go does not have try...catch exceptions. Functions that can fail return an error as their last return value. You are expected to check for it immediately.

Go

// This is the most common pattern in Go
value, err := someFunctionThatCanFail()
if err != nil {
    // Handle the error right here, right now
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("someFunctionThatCanFail failed: %w", err)
}
// If you're here, err is nil and value is good to use.
