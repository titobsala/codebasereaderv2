    Phase 1: Analysis Engine Overhaul 🔧

    1.1 Smart Dependency Analysis

    - Filter Import Categories: Separate internal imports (project modules) vs external 
    dependencies (third-party libraries)
    - Add Dependency Mapping: Create dependency graph showing actual project structure 
    relationships
    - Implement Import Analysis: Distinguish between standard library, external packages, and
     project-internal imports
    - Remove Noise: Filter out common external libraries from main analysis display

    1.2 Real-Time Progress System

    - Integrate Bubbles Progress Bar: Implement actual progress bar using 
    github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles/progress
    - Add File Scanning Phase: Show progress during file discovery phase
    - Implement Analysis Progress: Real-time updates showing current file being processed
    - Add Spinner Component: Use github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles/spinner for indeterminate 
    operations

    Phase 2: Modern Tabbed Interface 🎯

    2.1 Tab-Based Navigation System

    - Implement Official Tabs Component: Use bubbletea's official tabs example as foundation
    - Create Primary Tabs:
      - 📁 Explorer (current file tree + content)
      - 📊 Analysis (metrics and results)
      - ⚙️ Configuration (settings and preferences)
      - ❓ Help (comprehensive help system)

    2.2 Enhanced Analysis Tab

    - Sub-Tabs Within Analysis:
      - 📋 Overview (project summary)
      - 📈 Detailed (file-by-file metrics)
      - 🎯 Quality (code quality metrics)
      - 🔗 Dependencies (import analysis)
    - Intuitive Navigation: Clear tab labels with keyboard shortcuts
    - Visual Indicators: Active tab highlighting with lipgloss styling

    ---
    Phase 3: Advanced UI Components ✨

    3.1 Progress & Loading States

    - Analysis Progress Bar: 
      - File scanning phase with file count
      - Processing phase with current file name
      - Completion percentage with ETA
    - Spinner Integration: For initialization and indeterminate operations
    - Status Messages: Real-time status updates during operations

    3.2 Enhanced Styling & Layouts

    - Advanced Lipgloss Usage: 
      - Gradient backgrounds for tabs
      - Sophisticated borders and spacing
      - Color-coded sections (green for success, yellow for warnings, red for errors)
    - Responsive Layouts: Dynamic sizing based on terminal dimensions
    - Visual Data Representations: ASCII charts for language distribution

    ---
    Phase 4: Content & Display Improvements 📈

    4.1 Smart Analysis Results

    - Categorized Dependencies:
      - Internal: Project modules and local imports
      - External: Third-party libraries with version detection
      - Standard: Language standard library imports
    - Dependency Visualization: ASCII tree showing import relationships
    - Code Quality Metrics: Enhanced complexity analysis with quality grades

    4.2 Interactive Features

    - Drill-Down Capability: Click/navigate into specific files from metrics
    - Filtering Options: Filter results by language, file type, or quality metrics
    - Search Functionality: Find specific files or functions within results
    - Export Options: JSON, markdown, and Mermaid diagram generation

    ---
    Phase 5: Enhanced User Experience 🚀

    5.1 Improved Help & Discovery

    - Context-Sensitive Help: Different help content per tab
    - Comprehensive Keybind Display: Show all available shortcuts for current context
    - Interactive Tutorial: First-run guide showing key features
    - Feature Tooltips: Brief explanations of metrics and features

    5.2 Configuration & Preferences

    - Visual Configuration Tab: Interactive settings with immediate preview
    - Theme Support: Multiple color schemes and styling options
    - Analysis Preferences: Configure what metrics to calculate and display
    - Performance Tuning: Adjustable worker counts and analysis depth
