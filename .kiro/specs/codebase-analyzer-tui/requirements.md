# Requirements Document

## Introduction

CodebaseReader v2 is a multi-language codebase analysis and summarization tool with an interactive Terminal User Interface (TUI). The tool transforms from a single-language Python script into a high-performance, extensible Go application that can analyze various programming languages concurrently. It provides developers, team leads, and security auditors with quick insights into unfamiliar codebases through static analysis, code metrics, and AI-powered summaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Interactive File System Navigation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to navigate through project directories using an interactive TUI, so that I can easily explore and select codebases for analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display an interactive file tree of the current directory
2. WHEN a user presses arrow keys THEN the system SHALL navigate through the file tree accordingly
3. WHEN a user selects a directory THEN the system SHALL highlight the selection and allow further navigation
4. WHEN a user presses Enter on a directory THEN the system SHALL expand or collapse the directory contents
5. IF a directory contains no supported files THEN the system SHALL indicate this in the display

### Requirement 2: Multi-Language Code Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer working with polyglot codebases, I want the tool to analyze multiple programming languages, so that I can get comprehensive insights regardless of the technology stack.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system encounters a supported file type THEN it SHALL delegate analysis to the appropriate language parser
2. WHEN analyzing Go files THEN the system SHALL use the native go/parser package to extract functions, structs, and interfaces
3. WHEN analyzing Python files THEN the system SHALL use a compatible parser to extract classes, functions, and methods
4. IF an unsupported file type is encountered THEN the system SHALL skip it and continue processing other files
5. WHEN parsing fails for a file THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining files

### Requirement 3: Concurrent File Processing

**User Story:** As a user analyzing large codebases, I want the analysis to be fast and responsive, so that I can quickly get insights without waiting for long processing times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning a directory THEN the system SHALL process multiple files concurrently using goroutines
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent operations to prevent resource exhaustion
3. WHEN analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator or loading spinner
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL update the display with results immediately
5. IF the system encounters I/O errors THEN it SHALL handle them gracefully without blocking other operations

### Requirement 4: Code Metrics and Analysis Results

**User Story:** As a team lead reviewing code quality, I want to see comprehensive metrics about the codebase, so that I can understand the project's structure and complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display total lines of code for the selected directory
2. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL show counts of functions, classes, and other code constructs
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL organize metrics by file type and directory
4. WHEN a user selects a specific file THEN the system SHALL show detailed metrics for that file
5. IF complexity metrics are available THEN the system SHALL display cyclomatic complexity or similar measures

### Requirement 5: AI-Powered Code Summarization

**User Story:** As a developer exploring an unfamiliar codebase, I want AI-generated summaries of the code, so that I can quickly understand the project's purpose and architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests AI summarization THEN the system SHALL collect relevant code snippets and structure information
2. WHEN generating summaries THEN the system SHALL format the data into appropriate prompts for AI services
3. WHEN calling AI services THEN the system SHALL support multiple providers (Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible endpoints)
4. WHEN AI analysis completes THEN the system SHALL display the summary in a readable format within the TUI
5. IF AI service calls fail THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages and continue functioning

### Requirement 6: Configuration and Extensibility

**User Story:** As a user with specific AI provider preferences, I want to configure the tool with my API keys and settings, so that I can use my preferred services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read configuration from a config file or command-line flags
2. WHEN configuration includes API keys THEN the system SHALL store them securely and use them for AI service calls
3. WHEN adding a new language parser THEN the system SHALL require only implementing the Parser interface
4. WHEN registering parsers THEN the system SHALL use a registry pattern to map file extensions to parsers
5. IF configuration is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults and inform the user

### Requirement 7: Output and Export Capabilities

**User Story:** As a documentation writer, I want to export analysis results in various formats, so that I can include codebase insights in reports and documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL provide options to export results as JSON
2. WHEN generating visual outputs THEN the system SHALL support Mermaid diagram generation for project structure
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all collected metrics and analysis results
4. WHEN saving outputs THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify output file paths
5. IF export operations fail THEN the system SHALL display error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback about the application's status and any errors, so that I can understand what's happening and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages in the TUI
2. WHEN long operations are running THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators or status updates
3. WHEN the system encounters permission issues THEN it SHALL inform the user and suggest solutions
4. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry options where appropriate
5. IF the application crashes THEN it SHALL attempt to save any work in progress and display crash information
